    "text": "My Journey\nI am a first generation Peruvian immigrant who is passionate for improving the lives of people and bringing communities together. In the beginning of my career, I started working in the private wealth industry to help others achieve their investing goals by managing their investment data and presenting insights that would help them make informed decisions for their portfolios and finances. This interest in storytelling through data with purpose led me to pursue a Master’s degree in Data and Analytics from Northeastern. This educational experience broadened my horizons in how storytelling with data and the use of analytics can drive meaningful impact and organizational growth.\nWith this new perspective, I moved onto the healthcare industry in order to continue my pursuit of applying data, analytics and storytelling to drive and improve the lives of people. I started working at Premier where I am focused in formulating, designing and developing scalable solutions that aim to drive meaningful change and positive impact to business and communities that are most affected. I have led and contributed on multiple solutions  (i.e. application, dashboards, process improvements) through efforts in product design, product development, proof of concept building, evidence of business value generation and translating prototypes into production-ready solutions.\n🔗 View My Projects | 🔗 Read about my experience"
