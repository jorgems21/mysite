## Background context

-   Interest in home ownership for living and real estate investing

-   Moved to Nashville around 2022

-   Started as school project and are currently evolving it.

-   Data source: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmthyjames/nashville-housing-data)

## The Challenge: Key Questions To Answer

-   Find good deals for purchase during home buying journey in a tough market

## Objectives

-   Provide data-driven analysis of the real estate market in Nashville (and beyond) to help prospective home buyers identify the best deal for them.

## Solution Approach

### Tools & Techniques

-   Languages: R

-   Modeling Approach: Random Forest

-   App Development

    -   Front-end/back-end: R Shiny (UI/Server) and reactivity

    -   Visualizations: ggplot package in R

    -   Report generation: R Markdown

-   Design

    -   [Figma](housing_analysis_app_design.pdf)

### User Experience Flow

-   Step 1: Read home page description

-   Step 2: Check out the descriptive information for visualizations about housing in Nashville

-   Step 3: Go to the deal prediction tab to identify which housing profile would be considered a good deal based on your inputs being applied to a ML model.

    -   Step 3.1: Your inputs will update the model dynamically in the back end

    -   Step 3.2: The model is going to product a prediction based on your inputs and the source data

-   Step 4: Go to report generation which will dynamically produce a HTML/PDF report that includes all the visualizations from the application + the deal prediction insights.

## Analysis / Results

-   This tool is meant to provide data driven insights that will assist users in their journey to home-buying. This tool is in prototype phase and is not currently maintained.

-   The results for the deal prediction will be partially based on the user's inputs.

## Learnings and challenges

-   R Shiny is a great framework for rapid app prototyping that includes statistics and ML models

-   The predictions in the deal prediction tool are partly limited to the quantity and quality of the data, which comes from Kaggle.
