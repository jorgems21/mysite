## Background context

-   Source: School project

-   Objective: Help banks identify customers who are \*\*most likely to accept a loan approval\*\* based on past campaign results.

## The Challenge: Key Questions To Answer

-   How can banks improve loan approval decisions?\*\*

-   What factors influence a customer’s likelihood to accept a loan offer?\*\*

-   How can we optimize customer targeting to increase loan acceptance rates?\*\*

## Objectives

-   Data Exploration – Apply \*\*EDA techniques\*\* to uncover patterns in customer behavior.

-   Descriptive Analytics – Analyze \*\*relationships between variables\*\* and loan approvals.

-   Advanced Analytics – Build predictive models to \*\*profile ideal loan applicants\*\*.

## Solution Approach

### Tools & Techniques

-   Languages:\*\* Python

-   Modeling Approach:\*\* Logistic Regression, XGBoost

### Analytical Workflow

-   Step 1: Explore & clean the data

-   Step 2: Prepare data for analytics & machine learning models

-   Step 3: Conduct A/B testing for experimentation

-   Step 4: Apply logistic regression & XGBoost

-   Step 5: Compare model performances using visualizations

-   Step 6: Interpret results & quantify impact

## Analysis / Results

-   Identified key factors influencing loan acceptance rates.

-   Before vs. After Comparison: Improved model predictions through feature engineering.
