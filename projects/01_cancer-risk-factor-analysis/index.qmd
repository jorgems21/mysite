## Background context

-   Selected for analysis due to personal family ties to cancer, part of a school project

-   Dataset: \~3,000 rows, 34 variables

-   Data Period: Roughly from 2015

## The Challenge: Key Questions to Answer

-   What are the primary causes of cancer mortality?

-   Which risk factors contribute to higher cancer mortality rates at the county level?

    By answering these, we aim to empower public health initiatives with data-driven insights.

## Objectives

-   Descriptive Analytics – Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset.

-   Advanced Analytics – Use predictive modeling to identify factors associated with cancer mortality.

## Solution Approach

### Tools & Techniques

-   Languages: Python

-   Modeling Approach: Regression & Machine Learning

### Analytical Workflow

-   Step 1: Explore & clean the data

-   Step 2: Prepare data for machine learning models

-   Step 3: Apply regression analysis & ML techniques

-   Step 4: Evaluate & interpret results

-   Step 5: Summarize findings & quantify impact

## Analysis / Results

-   Before vs. After Comparison: Impact of different models on prediction accuracy.

-   Quantified Risk Factors: Which factors have the strongest correlation with mortality rates?

## Learnings and challenges

-   Cross-validation is crucial for model reliability and is part of the next iteration

-   Hyperparameter tuning\*\* improved accuracy but was time-intensive.

-   Stacking models\*\* significantly increased compute time.

-   XGBoost outperformed other models\*\* in predictive accuracy.

-   Data quality & preprocessing\*\* played a major role in improving results.
