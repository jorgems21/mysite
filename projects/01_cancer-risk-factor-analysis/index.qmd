## Background context

o   Over 3,000 rows and 34 columns/ variables

o   Roughly from 2015

o   School project

o   Picked it as one of the datasets to study for class because of family ties with cancer

## The problem or challenge or key questions to answer

o   What are the causes for cancer mortality?

o   Identify what are the risk factors for cancer mortality based on county level data from US

## Objectives

§  Apply descriptive analysis to understand and explore the data

§  Apply advance analytics to understand the causes for cancer mortality in the US

## Solution Approach

o   Tools/techniques (R, python, tableau) and methodology (regression)

§  Python

o   Planning execution

§  Explore data

§  Clean data

§  Prepare data for analytic functions

§  Create analytic functions

§  Post-process the data

§  Interpret information

## Analysis / Results 

The analysis conducted to evaluate various machine learning models for predicting cancer mortality rates has demonstrated that the **boosting method**, specifically the XGBoost algorithm, is the most effective approach. The model achieved a **training accuracy of 91.80%**, indicating its strong ability to learn from the training data. Furthermore, the model attained a **testing accuracy of 67.44%**, reflecting its capability to generalize to unseen data with a reasonable level of performance.

## Learnings and challenges

o   Cross validation

o   Hyperparameter tuning

o   Stacking takes long time

o   Xgboost is really good

-    Data quality is important
